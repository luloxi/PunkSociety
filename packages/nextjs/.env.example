# For local development, copy this file, rename it to .env.local, and fill in the values.
# When deploying live, you'll need to store the vars in Vercel/System config.

# If not set, we provide default values (check `scaffold.config.ts`) so developers can start prototyping out of the box,
# but we recommend getting your own API Keys for Production Apps.

# To access the values stored in this env file you can use: process.env.VARIABLENAME
# You'll need to prefix the variables names with NEXT_PUBLIC_ if you want to access them on the client side.

# If you want to connect to a live Firebase project, you can download the service account key JSON
# and add the path here;
### Commented out as per instructions by ChatGPT
# GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/<your>/<path>/<to>/firebaseServiceAccountKey.json"
# OR copy/paste these values from the JSON file (easier for production environments):
# FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL="your_firebase_admin_sdk_email@your_project_id.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
# FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN...END PRIVATE"

# If you want to connect to the Firebase emulator
FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:8080

# Setup you project id for firebase
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="technai-v1"

# Setup api-key for admin
ADMIN_API_KEY="admin-api-key"
